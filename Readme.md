# Customer Support Chatbot with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is a **Customer Support Chatbot** powered by **Machine Learning**. The chatbot is designed to assist users by interpreting their queries, searching the database for resolutions, and escalating unresolved issues to support staff. It also learns from past interactions to improve response accuracy over time.

## Objectives
- Automate **customer query resolution** to reduce support workload.
- Use **Machine Learning** to enhance chatbot intelligence and adaptability.
- Implement **sentiment analysis** to gauge user satisfaction.
- Maintain a **self-learning system** that improves responses over time.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Understands and processes user queries.
- **Database Querying**: Searches for relevant answers from a predefined knowledge base.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes user emotions to enhance interaction quality.
- **Escalation Mechanism**: Transfers complex queries to human agents.
- **Self-Learning & Improvement**: Uses past interactions to refine accuracy.
- **Multi-Channel Support**: Deployable on websites, mobile apps, and messaging platforms.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy
- **NLP Frameworks**: Transformers, GPT, BERT
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Web Framework**: Flask/Django (for API and UI integration)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL for storing query responses
- **Cloud Services**: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud, or Azure for hosting

## Data Collection & Processing
The chatbot is trained on:
- **FAQs and historical support data**
- **Customer service chat logs**
- **User feedback and sentiment labels**
- **Industry-specific terminology**

## Machine Learning Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization.
2. **Intent Recognition**: Uses NLP models to classify user intents.
3. **Response Generation**: Retrieves answers from the database or formulates dynamic responses.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Identifies user sentiment to improve engagement.
5. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Uses supervised learning to improve accuracy.
